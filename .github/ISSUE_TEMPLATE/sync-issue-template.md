## Description

1. Sync the values in the **Synced** list below.
2. Create an integration test for all values (1 for server changing the value and 1 for client changing the value if applicable)
3. Create a command to test changing the value in game [see similar command](https://github.com/Bannerlord-Coop-Team/BannerlordCoop/blob/development/source/GameInterface/Services/Towns/Commands/TownDebugCommand.cs#L455)

Also see additional information at the bottom for more information and templates

<!-- Describe why this issue is needed. -->
**Key**
Server side only (only allow the running of the function on the server side)
Client side only (only allow the running of the function on the client side)
Client side sync (request the server to change the value, server then changes the value and replies to the client allowing the change)
Server side sync (only server allows running of the function and send to all clients the value changed and clients update the value/call original function)

**Synced**
<!-- Add all method/fields below -->
| Method/Field Name | Sync Type |
|:-----------------:|:---------:|
|                   |           |

**Deferred**
<!-- Add deffered (covered by a field in the Synced table) --->
None

**Externally Deferred**
<!-- Add externally deffered (covered by a different sync) --->
None

**Non-Synced**
None

## Intended Design
<!-- Provide any relevant design documents, create any if complexity requires. -->

Using the [GameInterface Service Tempale](https://github.com/Bannerlord-Coop-Team/BannerlordCoop/tree/development/source/GameInterface/Services/Template) create commands to test the synced values.

For network communication use [Server Service Template](https://github.com/Bannerlord-Coop-Team/BannerlordCoop/tree/development/source/Coop.Core/Server/Services/Template) and [Client Service Template](https://github.com/Bannerlord-Coop-Team/BannerlordCoop/tree/development/source/Coop.Core/Client/Services/Template)

It is recommended to start with an integration test, you can create one using the [test template](https://github.com/Bannerlord-Coop-Team/BannerlordCoop/tree/development/source/Coop.IntegrationTests/Template).

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Class level comments exist for all new classes.
- [ ] XUnit tests exist for every method that does not require the game to be ran.
<!-- Create more required items as needed. -->
